# DataScrape_Challenge

The repository, DataScrape_challenge contains 3 files. Two are Jupyter Notebooks titled, 
"part_1_mars_news" and "part_2_mars_weather". 

Part 1 Mars News scrapes data from articles listed on this website:

The final output is a list of dictionaries storing the title and preview text of each 
article. 

Part 2 Mars Weather analyzes data scraped from a table on this website:
